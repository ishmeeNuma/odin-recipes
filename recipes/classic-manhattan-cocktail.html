        <h3>Desciption</h3>
            <p>Tasteful. Flavorful. Distinguished. Timeless.</p>
            <p>The Manhattan was the most famous cocktail in the world shortly after it was invented in New York Cityâ€™s Manhattan Club, some time around 1880 (as the story goes). Over the years, the whiskey classic has dipped in and out of fashion before finding its footing as one of the cornerstones of the craft cocktail renaissance. </p>
            <p>A lion doesn't have to tell other animals that it's a lion.  So it goes with the Manhattan.  <em>Cheers.</em></p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ice</li>

                <li>1 part sweet vermouth</li>
                <li>1-2 dashes bitters (Angostura works great!)</li>
                <li>Orange peel</li>
                <li>Real Maraschino cherries (see recipe below)</li>
            </ul>

        <h5>Maraschino Cherries</h5>

                <li>1 C Maraschino liqueur</li>
                <li>1 pint sour cherries, stemmed and pitted (if you find yourself in a pinch, you can buy a jar of sour cherries in light syrup, and just drain the syrup. It'll work!)</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Place ice in a cocktail shaker. Add the whiskey, vermouth and bitters. Rub the orange peel around the rim of the cocktail glass. Strain the drink into the glass. Add 1 to 2 Real Maraschino Cherries and enjoy! </li>
                <li>To prepare the real Maraschino Cherries, bring the liqueur to a simmer, and then turn off the heat. Add the cherries, stir, let cool, and then pour into jars. Refrigerate. Cherries will be tasty for months. </li>
