        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Rise n' shine! Up and at 'em!  Saddle up, partners!.... but first, <em>breakfast!</em></p>
            <p>The morning fave known as the Western omelette is also known as a <em>Denver</em> omelette or a <em>Southwestern</em> omelette. The filling includes diced ham, green bell pepper, and onion. Feel free to add a little shredded cheddar or pepper jack if you like cheese in your eggs, but this recipe is for the Western omelette purist so weâ€™ve skipped the cheese.  I like to keep it spicy, so I recommend serving hot sauce like Tabasco or Sriracha on the side.</p>
            <p>Fuel your morning forward with this timeless, rugged, and rustic classic (with a cup o' coffee, too, of course).  <em>Enjoy!!</em></p>
            
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>6 large eggs</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp. milk</li>
                <li>2-3 Tbsp. unsalted butter</li>
                <lI>1/2 C onion, small diced</lI>
                <li>1/2 C green bell pepper, small diced</li>
                <li>1/2 C ham, cooked & diced</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Optional Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>your choice of cheese (my preferences are cheddar, white cheddar, pepper jack, or queso fresco)</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk until frothy.</li>
                <li>In a large non-stick pan, melt one Tablespoon of butter. Add in half of the onions and bell peppers and cook, stirring until translucent.  Add in half of the ham and cook for another minute, stirring while ham is cooking.</li>
                <li>Add another piece of butter and swirl around pan to melt.  Add half of the beaten eggs, and swirl around pan to form a large circle.</li>
                <li>Turn heat to medium-low and cover with a lid for about 2 minutes. Check that your edges are not browning.  If they are, remove your pan from heat and reduce the heat. Once the eggs are solid and cooked almost through, flip the entire circle and cook for one more minute.</li>
                <li>Roll or fold the omelette onto a plate and serve.  Repeat the above steps for a second omelette.</li>
            </ol>
